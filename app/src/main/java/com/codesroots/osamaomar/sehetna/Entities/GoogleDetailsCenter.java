On January 28, 2019, my father, may God have mercy on him, was transferred to Dar al-Fuad Hospital that is located in Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt. And, as I understood that this hospital has a collaboration with the great Cleveland, Ohio, clinic that is very well known by it's outstanding/exceptional treatment by the medical/managerial team towards the patients. When my beautiful father arrived at the hospital early morning suffering from initial symptoms of a septic shock, he was transferred to the ICU. A few hours later, I touched down in Cairo and went immediately to the hospital to be next to my father and was shocked at that time by observing more than one crime by the hospital team towards the patients.\n\nFirst, I want to talk about the humanitarian aspect. The great disaster was when I was walking through the ICU floor that is located in the 2nd on my way to see my dad during one of the visits, I assumed it must be a sterilized area as there are patients out there with severe pulmonary/cardiovascular diseases and most of them are under electronic ventilation support like my father.. I smelled a cloud of cigarette smoke and then I could not believe I my eyes/nose that I'm in a hospital, forget even that it was INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. \n\nImmediately, I found myself running to the security team asking for help to find out where the severe smoke is coming from. The security officer ran with me and opened one of the rooms that is located inches away from my father and my heart stopped for some seconds when I saw the smoke is coming out of this room that has a sign on it says \"Doctors Rest Area\". Two doctors came out of this room and I asked one of them who is named Dr. Hadi and he is a Cardiovascular MD. I told him: Dr, how do you feel about smoking cigarettes next to patients who you definitely know that they are in serious medical complications? I was shocked by his reaction when he turned his head on me and said: \"So what do you want now\"?. At this point, I decided to end my conversation with him as I completely didn't see a Dr who cares about his patients as my dad used to care about his patients while practicing medicine as a gynecology physician. \n\nI went to the Security Director in the hospital and I wrote a full report introducing this incident and then the security director told me, \"Thank you for doing this. We are tired of the Dr's attitude in smoking and this report may help\" At that time, I had a hope in heart that this report may help to stop this sad irresponsible atmosphere. But after two days, during one of the visits to my father, I smelled the same terrible cigarette again but that time I even noticed a smoke running through the aisle on it's the way to the patients. That moment, I didn't wait for security to help as I knew where the smoke is coming from, and, I found myself opening the same exact room again to see a horrible/terrible view of two Dr's wearing their lap coat and setting/enjoying their cigarette session \"INSIDE THE ICU UNIT\"\n\nMy dad was not treated properly by the medical team and they ignored/delayed many things in his case that was one of the reasons for him leaving our life. But I'm not here to speak about this as I'm more concern and afraid of the future patients who will get affected by the medical team being a reason of the getting them into severe medical complications due to their selfish attitude. \n\nMy God Is Dead Now. But I Hope The Hospital Team Will CHange Their Crimes Attitude Against The Patients. \n\nVery Sad..","time":1550783757},{"author_name":"Amr Ezzat","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111292526808005195069/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-LPkPf1ibpDs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfv9uTo2h3uzadZkY7ElrBFrJ-_LA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"4 weeks ago","text":"Very poor cat service , even when u ask to complain , there is no one , they ask u to leave ur info and someone will call back tom, so issue will not be resolved if u need solution in the same day in one of the 5 most expensive hospitals !!","time":1552838344},{"author_name":"Hady Gohar","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109122890530949126410/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ISq1qPfaLkM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJgQ/Dw_kdtt6Rpo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"don\u2019t go as salam. here you are my experience:\ni have done a surgery in my shoulder and stayed there a couple days:\npros:\nthe room is well decorated, recently renovated, check in was fast and good, nice view overlooking the nile.\ncons:\n- i asked for extra cover - never got it\n- i asked to change the pillow so i can sleep, they said they can\u2019t change it as this room type doesn\u2019t have the comfy type, only in the VIP, i had to call the management to get a pillow which came after two hours of complains\n- loud noises from the nurses, cleaning workers and guests even during night time\n- bathroom was clean but the room itself wasn\u2019t\n- the cover after the surgery had some blood in it and no one bother to change it\n- nursing is disaster: anything u ask from the nurse u get after an hour or two\n- after the anesthesia effect were gone, i had sever pain and heat in my bone, i called the nurse and asked for painkiller, he brought the painkiller 40 minutes later\n- 2 hours after the pain came back and asked for stronger painkiller, the nurse responded back after 1 hour\n- i asked for a doctor to help me with the pain, i asked to see the night shift doctor to help me with the pain, no one showed up until my doctor arrived the next day.\n- even the canola was put wrong and my vain exploded ( just as the doctor described it) and ended with bloody bed \n\n- neither the little things were good (house keeping, room service) lots of delays in all aspects\n\ni suffered a lot in this hospital despite it was paid as premium. \n\nNo more salam hospital- you are just a big shame","time":1545854713},{"author_name":"Mariam Atteya","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102208511926789757182/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L2KaSd1a9D4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfPGUKDAm19IUdYJnNvFMz79kjkYg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Administration Staff either in hospital or clinics is really bad unprofessional\nThe traffic of check in & check out is totally unorganized\nThe clinics system is the worest I have ever seen in my life\nThe staff is really unprofessional\nHowever the hospital is clean\nThey need to work on thier managerial skills more to understand that they deal with sick people not normal customers","time":1548751119},{"author_name":"alaa fathy","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114740801292275672439/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1u7dGCRStdw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAj4k/La72gjtuJiI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"Good health care, nursing and clean rooms","time":1555052002}],"vicinity":"Corniche El Nile, Athar an Nabi, Misr Al Qadimah"}

             To whom it may concern,

             Hope this message will be taken into consideration.

             I am an Egyptian citizen who moved to become a resident in the U.S since some years back. On January 28, 2019, my father, may God have mercy on him, was transferred to Dar al-Fuad Hospital that is located in Nasr City, Cairo, Egypt. And, as I understood that this hospital has a collaboration with the great Cleveland, Ohio, clinic that is very well known by it's outstanding/exceptional treatment by the medical/managerial team towards the patients. When my beautiful father arrived at the hospital early morning suffering from initial symptoms of a septic shock, he was transferred to the ICU. A few hours later, I touched down in Cairo and went immediately to the hospital to be next to my father and was shocked at that time by observing more than one crime by the hospital team towards the patients.

             First, I want to talk about the humanitarian aspect. The great disaster was when I was walking through the ICU floor that is located in the 2nd on my way to see my dad during one of the visits, I assumed it must be a sterilized area as there are patients out there with severe pulmonary/cardiovascular diseases and most of them are under electronic ventilation support like my father.. I smelled a cloud of cigarette smoke and then I could not believe I my eyes/nose that I'm in a hospital, forget even that it was INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.

             Immediately, I found myself running to the security team asking for help to find out where the severe smoke is coming from. The security officer ran with me and opened one of the rooms that is located inches away from my father and my heart stopped for some seconds when I saw the smoke is coming out of this room that has a sign on it says "Doctors Rest Area". Two doctors came out of this room and I asked one of them who is named Dr. Hadi and he is a Cardiovascular MD. I told him: Dr, how do you feel about smoking cigarettes next to patients who you definitely know that they are in serious medical complications? I was shocked by his reaction when he turned his head on me and said: "So what do you want now"?. At this point, I decided to end my conversation with him as I completely didn't see a Dr who cares about his patients as my dad used to care about his patients while practicing medicine as a gynecology physician.

             I went to the Security Director in the hospital and I wrote a full report introducing this incident and then the security director told me, "Thank you for doing this. We are tired of the Dr's attitude in smoking and this report may help" At that time, I had a hope in heart that this report may help to stop this sad irresponsible atmosphere. But after two days, during one of the visits to my father, I smelled the same terrible cigarette again but that time I even noticed a smoke running through the aisle on it's the way to the patients. That moment, I didn't wait for security to help as I knew where the smoke is coming from, and, I found myself opening the same exact room again to see a horrible/terrible view of two Dr's wearing their lap coat and setting/enjoying their cigarette session "INSIDE THE ICU UNIT"

             My dad was not treated properly by the medical team and they ignored/delayed many things in his case that was one of the reasons for him leaving our life. But I'm not here to speak about this as I'm more concern and afraid of the future patients who will get affected by the medical team being a reason of the getting them into severe medical complications due to their selfish attitude.

             My God Is Dead Now. But I Hope The Hospital Team Will CHange Their Crimes Attitude Against The Patients.

             Very Sad..
